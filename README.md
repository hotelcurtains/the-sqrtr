> The Sqrtr is a simulation of a sequential CPU made for Logisim-evolution.

An 8-bit computer emulated in Logisim-evolution, made for CS 382 with Professor Shudong Hao. 
- Check out [the docs](https://github.com/hotelcurtains/the-sqrtr/blob/1a3d5620ce9ea7188981c1f29ae566235d17fb1e/docs.pdf) to learn all of the hows and whys.
- Two demo programs are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the Sqrtr.
- An interpreter, written in Python, is included. Running it will require Python.
- The Sqrtr (including the circuit and interpreter) can only be guaranteed functional with [Python 3.12.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/) and
[Logisim-evolution v3.9.0](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases/tag/v3.9.0) on Windows 11 Home 23H2 and Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.05 LTS.
I haven't seen any proof that it breaks in other circumstances, but keep this point in mind nonetheless.
